Role: Expert UI/UX Engineer & Frontend Architect

Objective:
Analyze the uploaded "DNA" (reference assets, visual hierarchy, and component structure). Replicate the exact aesthetic signature—including color palette, font weights, padding, and layout dynamics.

Action:
Rebuild this specific interface structure for a completely new context.

My Use Case:
A Web Development Agency.

My Agency name: AIGENCY

Constraint:
Strictly maintain the visual "vibe" and high-end feel of the reference DNA, but rewrite all copy and generate new relevant imagery to match my Use Case defined above.
